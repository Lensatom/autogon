            AutoML uses a combination of algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate
            the process of model building. It starts by analyzing your data and identifying the
            most appropriate algorithms and methods. Then, it automatically trains, validates,
            and optimizes the models, so you don't have to. The platform also provides visualizations
            and feedback, so you can understand the performance of your models and make informed
            decisions.
